- 👋 Hi, I’m Pedro.
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things.
- 🌿 I've already passed through HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also learned a little bit of Node.js with Express.js, but I didn't really delve into it too much (but i'm willing to learn it more seriously in the future).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React.js.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Front-End Web Development.
